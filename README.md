# WebsiteToApp

**Welcome** \
Thanks for chosing my project here. It is an easy to use tool to make your favourite Website into an App \
You just put in the link to your website and it will create a Desktop shortcut to the Website in an app format 
___
**Setup** \
-Download the zip file via this link: https://www.mediafire.com/file/yzmvmp95ms3q89y/v1.0.zip/file (i cant rly upload it like that here) \
-extract the zip file \
-copy into C:/Program Files \
-open the setup.exe file \
-put in name and URL (name is gonna be displayed on top of the window) \
-click finish and the shortcut should appear on your desktop

**Tip** \
-some websites are not made to be in an app format so use shortcuts to navigate if needed
--> alt + left to go back
--> alt + right to go forth
