**Welcome**
Thanks for chosing my project here. It is an easy to use tool to make your favourite Website into an App \

**Setup**
-Download one of the releases \
-Execute the setup.exe file \
-Fill in the name and url of the Website \
--> the name is gonna be in the bar on top of the programm \
--> both can changed by simply opening the setup file again \
-Put the whole folder into C:\Program Files  (you dont need to but then you cannot delete it on accident) \
-Make a shortcut to the browser.exe file in the browser directory \
